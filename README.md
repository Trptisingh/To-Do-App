# üìù To-Do CRUD

## üß© Overview

This project is part of the **JavaScript hands-on learning series**.
It demonstrates a complete **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** flow for a simple **To-Do List Application**, built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** ‚Äî without using any loops for rendering.

The app stores data in both **LocalStorage** (for offline persistence) and an external temporary backend, **CrudCrud API**, to simulate real database operations.
It also introduces the concept of using **recursion** to display data instead of traditional loops.

## üß† What is CRUD?

**CRUD** stands for:

* **C ‚Äì Create:** Add new data or items (e.g., a new task)
* **R ‚Äì Read:** Retrieve and display data (e.g., list all tasks)
* **U ‚Äì Update:** Modify existing data (e.g., edit a task)
* **D ‚Äì Delete:** Remove data (e.g., delete a task)

CRUD operations form the backbone of most web applications, allowing dynamic interaction with databases or storage.

## üß† How CrudCrud API Helps

**CrudCrud** is a free, temporary REST API used to simulate a real backend without setting up a server.

It allows the app to perform **CRUD operations over HTTP**:

| Operation  | Example Use in App                                          |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **POST**   | Add a new task to the backend when a user clicks ‚ÄúAdd Task‚Äù |
| **GET**    | Fetch all tasks from the backend on page load               |
| **PUT**    | Update a task‚Äôs content when a user clicks ‚ÄúUpdate‚Äù         |
| **DELETE** | Remove a task from the backend when a user clicks ‚ÄúDelete‚Äù  |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Data on CrudCrud is **temporary** and resets every 24 hours. It‚Äôs perfect for testing and learning CRUD without a full backend setup.

## üß† Learning Objectives

This project helps learners understand:

### Core CRUD Logic

* Create, Read, Update, and Delete tasks dynamically
* Understand how user actions affect both UI and stored data

### LocalStorage Integration

* Store and retrieve data from the browser
* Keep data even after refreshing the page

### Backend Simulation via API

* Connect to a mock backend using the **CrudCrud REST API**
* Learn how to use `fetch()` for **POST, PUT, and DELETE** requests

### Recursion Concept

* Replace traditional loops (`for`, `while`) with recursive function calls
* Understand **base** and **recursive conditions** through real implementation

### DOM Manipulation

* Dynamically create HTML elements for tasks
* Handle events like button clicks for update/delete actions

## ‚öôÔ∏è How the App Works

### Page Load

* Tasks are automatically loaded from **LocalStorage** using recursion

### Add a Task

* Type a new task and click **‚ÄúAdd Task‚Äù**
* Task is displayed on screen, saved to **LocalStorage**, and sent to CrudCrud via **POST request**

### Update a Task

* Click **‚ÄúUpdate‚Äù** ‚Üí enter new text in a prompt
* Change is updated locally and via **PUT request** on CrudCrud

### Delete a Task

* Click **‚ÄúDelete‚Äù** ‚Üí removes the task from **DOM**, **LocalStorage**, and CrudCrud via **DELETE request**

### Recursive Rendering

* Instead of using loops, tasks are displayed one by one using a recursive function:

```javascript
displayTaskRecursively(index);
```

## üìö Key Learning Takeaways

‚úÖ CRUD operation flow in real web apps
‚úÖ Working with asynchronous JavaScript (`async / await`)
‚úÖ Using **LocalStorage** for persistence
‚úÖ Understanding **recursion** practically
‚úÖ Clean **UI & DOM** event handling
‚úÖ Integrating frontend logic with an external API

## üß∞ Developer Tips

* Check your **Browser Console ‚Üí Network Tab** to see live API requests
* CrudCrud data is **temporary** ‚Äî it automatically resets every 24 hours
* You can freely modify the `API_URL` constant in `script.js` with your own CrudCrud endpoint
* This is a **no-loop challenge**, so focus on understanding how recursion works in task rendering
